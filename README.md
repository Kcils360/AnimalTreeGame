# AnimalTreeGame
##Create a game that asks questions and takes user y or n to guess an animal

I used a tutorial for a 20 questions game that I found at http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/4a950c/20-questions-guessing-game-using-binary-trees/

This uses the Node class to do most of the heavy lifting setting noNode and yesNode as the left/right properties of the node.

The UpdateTree method is what handles creating new nodes based on the user response to questions.
